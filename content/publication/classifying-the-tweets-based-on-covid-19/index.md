abstract: "In the current scenario, almost all the countries face one of the biggest disasters in COVID-19. This paper has to analyze the tweets related to COVID 19 and discuss the various machine learning algorithms and their performance analysis on the tweets associated with COVID-19. The implemented classification algorithms are applied to classify the sentiments to predict whether they relate to COVID-19 or non-COVID-19. Ten most popular classification algorithms implemented. The Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) achieved the highest test accuracy in these algorithms with 90.3%. Logistic regression has performed better in recall with 96.06%, F1 score of 90.46%, ROC_AUC with 90.48%. Random forest classifier has achieved the better specificity and precision of 99.16% and 96.3%, respectively. Out of all, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has attained better results in all the computational parameters"
