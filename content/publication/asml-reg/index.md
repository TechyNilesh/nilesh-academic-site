abstract: "ASML-REG extends automated machine learning capabilities to data stream regression tasks. This work addresses the unique challenges of regression in streaming environments, including concept drift detection, adaptive model selection, and real-time performance optimization. The system automatically selects and configures regression algorithms, handles feature engineering, and maintains prediction accuracy as data distributions evolve over time. Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior performance compared to static AutoML approaches on various streaming regression benchmarks."
