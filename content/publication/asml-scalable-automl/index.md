abstract: "This paper presents ASML (Automated Streaming Machine Learning), a scalable and efficient AutoML solution specifically designed for data streams. As data streams become increasingly prevalent in real-world applications, traditional AutoML approaches face significant challenges due to concept drift, limited computational resources, and the need for real-time processing. ASML addresses these challenges by incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms, efficient model selection strategies, and resource-aware optimization techniques. Our experimental evaluation on multiple streaming datasets demonstrates that ASML achieves superior performance compared to existing AutoML solutions while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time applications."
