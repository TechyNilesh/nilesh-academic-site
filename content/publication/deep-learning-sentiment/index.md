abstract: "This research presents an integrated approach combining multiple deep learning techniques for comprehensive sentiment and emotion analysis of social media data. The study explores the synergistic effects of combining convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformer-based models for enhanced emotion recognition accuracy. The framework processes textual social media content to identify not only sentiment polarity but also specific emotional states, providing deeper insights into user psychological patterns. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to individual deep learning approaches across multiple social media datasets."
