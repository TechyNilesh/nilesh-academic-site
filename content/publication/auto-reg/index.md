abstract: "Auto-Reg introduces a comprehensive AutoML framework tailored for streaming regression scenarios. The framework dynamically adapts to changing data characteristics through intelligent algorithm selection, automated feature engineering, and real-time hyperparameter optimization. Key innovations include a novel concept drift detection mechanism integrated with regression-specific metrics and an adaptive ensemble approach that maintains prediction quality under evolving data distributions. The system demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency across diverse streaming regression tasks."
