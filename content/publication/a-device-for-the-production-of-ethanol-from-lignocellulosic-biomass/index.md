  Device (100) for obtaining ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass, the device
  (100) comprising:a closed container (102) for collecting and storing the
  lignocellulosic biomass such as rice hulls in the form of powder, the powder
  being obtained by mixing with a mixer, wherein the collected powder is stored
  at a temperature below room temperature;a pre-treatment chamber (104) in
  connection with a closed container (102) for performing a variety of
  pretreatment processes on the collected rice hull powder, wherein a variety of
  reagents/chemicals are added to the added to collected rice husk powder to
  conduct delignification and de-toxification;a filter crucible (106) in
  communication with the pre-treatment chamber (104) for collecting and
  filtering the pretreated rice husk after washing with distilled water under
  suction and drying at 30-40°C; an enzyme extraction flask (108) in connection
  ung with the pretreatment chamber (104) for the extraction of crude cellulase
  enzyme from Trichoderma reesei, the extraction being carried out by adding
  (per liter) 40-50 g

  wheat bran, 10-20 g yeast extract, 5-15 g glucose, 1. 5-3 g NH4Cl, 0.5 g thiamine hydrochloride, 2.0 g K2HPO4, 0.5 g MgSO4.7H2O, 0.1 g CaCl2 and 0.5 g KCl, wherein Trichoderma reesei is incubated and centrifuged to produce a supernatant which is a source of enzyme;a test tube (110) in Connection to the flask (108), mixing 0.5 to 2 ml of 0.05 M sodium citrate pH 4.8 with 0.5 ml of the enzyme to prepare a second solution, placing a strip of filter paper in the test tube and leaving it in for 60 minutes a water bath at 50°C, after 60 minutes the test tube is taken out and the amount of sugars released by the cellulase is determined using the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNA) method;a vessel (112) in connection with the enzyme extraction co lben (108) and the test tube (110) for the enzymatic hydrolysis of 200-400 g of native and delignified rice husk (ie 2% nitric acid (HNO3), 10% HNO3, 2% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 10% NaOH), the rice hulls are soaked in a citrate buffer for 1-5 hours prior to addition of the prepared enzymes, with sodium azide being added at a concentration of 0.005% to limit microbial growth during the course of enzyme hydrolysis; andan Erlenmeyer flask (114) in connection with the vessel (112) for preparing ethanol by mixing 20 g/l of pre-treated rice hulls from hydrolysis with 200 ml of citrate buffer (pH 5.0 ± 0.2, 50 mM), followed by sterilization for 15 minutes at 15 psi (121°C) with rice hulls soaked in citrate buffer and supplemented with cellulase at a substrate to enzyme ratio of 1:5 (20 g pretreated substrate: 100 ml crude cellulase), inoculating immobilized yeast cells at various concentrations , fermented and centrifuged to analyze the ethanol concentration.

  buffer (pH 5.0 ± 0.2, 50 mM), followed by sterilization for 15 minutes at 15
  psi (121°C) with rice hulls soaked in citrate buffer and supplemented with
  cellulase at a substrate to enzyme ratio of 1:5 (20 g pretreated substrate:
  100 ml crude cellulase), inoculating immobilized yeast cells at various
  concentrations, fermented and centrifuged to analyze the ethanol
  concentration."
