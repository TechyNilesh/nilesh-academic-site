abstract: "This paper presents Bayesian Stream Tuner, a novel framework for dynamic hyperparameter optimization in real-time data stream environments. Traditional hyperparameter optimization methods are inadequate for streaming scenarios due to concept drift and the need for continuous adaptation. Our approach leverages Bayesian optimization techniques to dynamically adjust hyperparameters as data characteristics evolve, ensuring optimal model performance throughout the stream lifecycle. The framework incorporates uncertainty quantification and adaptive exploration strategies specifically designed for non-stationary environments."
