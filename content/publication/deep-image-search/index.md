abstract: "Deep Image Search is an AI-powered image search engine that leverages deep transfer learning for feature extraction and tree-based vectorized search techniques for efficient retrieval. The system implements state-of-the-art computer vision models to extract meaningful visual features from images and enables semantic similarity-based search capabilities. The engine supports large-scale image datasets and provides fast, accurate image retrieval based on visual content similarity. This open-source project has gained significant community adoption with practical applications in e-commerce, digital asset management, and content discovery systems."
